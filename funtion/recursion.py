# '''So for the explaination to muself here i have used recursion or recurive function to print manoj several times as the user wants and the steps are 
# 1 you define it like a normal function
# 2 you gotta have the base condition whiwhc means if something is aomething than abort or else go on with the code
# then you do your first task and just recall the function and modify it accordingly so that sometime it will definately meet the base condition and it will be aborted '''
